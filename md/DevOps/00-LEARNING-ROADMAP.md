## PHASE 1: FOUNDATIONS (Week 1-2)

### PREREQUISITES CHECK

Before starting, ensure you're comfortable with:

o Linux command line basics
- Navigation (cd, ls, pwd)
- File operations (cp, mv, rm, cat, less)
- Process management (ps, top, kill)
- Text editing (vim/nano)
- Package management (apt/yum)

o Basic networking concepts
- IP addresses, ports, protocols
- HTTP/HTTPS basics
- DNS fundamentals

o YAML syntax
- Indentation, lists, dictionaries
- Multi-line strings

If you need to brush up, spend the first week on Linux fundamentals.

### LEARNING GOALS FOR PHASE 2-3

By the end of Docker phases, you should be able to:

Y Explain Docker architecture (client, daemon, containerd, runc)
Y Build optimized Docker images with multi-stage builds
Y Write Dockerfiles following best practices
Y Use volumes for data persistence
Y Create multi-container applications with Docker Compose
Y Understand Docker networking modes
Y Implement security best practices
Y Push/pull images from registries

## PHASE 4: KUBERNETES FUNDAMENTALS (Week 5-7)

### WHY KUBERNETES AFTER DOCKER?

Docker solves: "How do I package and run a single application?"
Kubernetes solves: "How do I run 100+ containers across 50+ servers?"
