### Q2: HOW DO YOU HANDLE 250,000+ LOCATION UPDATES PER SECOND?

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                         |
|  ANSWER                                                                |
|                                                                         |
|  1. INGESTION TIER                                                     |
|     * Stateless location ingestion service                           |
|     * Horizontally scaled (100+ instances)                           |
|     * Each handles ~2,500 updates/sec                                |
|     * Load balanced across instances                                 |
|                                                                         |
|  2. STORAGE TIER                                                       |
|     * Current location: Redis (in-memory for speed)                  |
|     * History: Kafka > Time-series DB (for analytics)               |
|     * Shard by driver_id or geographic region                       |
|                                                                         |
|  3. OPTIMIZATIONS                                                      |
|     * Batch writes (accumulate 100ms, write batch)                  |
|     * Skip insignificant updates (<10m movement)                    |
|     * Use UDP for lower latency (trade reliability)                 |
|     * Connection pooling to Redis                                    |
|     * Compress location data                                         |
|                                                                         |
|  4. DATA MODEL IN REDIS                                                |
|     * driver:{id}:location > {lat, lng, heading, ts}               |
|     * cell:{s2_cell} > Set<driver_ids>  (for spatial query)        |
|     * Update both atomically when location changes                  |
|                                                                         |
|  5. GEOGRAPHIC SHARDING                                                |
|     * Shard Redis by city/region                                     |
|     * NYC drivers on one cluster, LA on another                     |
|     * Reduces cross-region latency                                   |
|                                                                         |

### Q3: WHY USE S2/H3 INSTEAD OF SIMPLE LAT/LNG?

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                         |
|  ANSWER                                                                |
|                                                                         |
|  PROBLEM WITH LAT/LNG                                                  |
|  * "Find drivers within 3km" requires checking every driver         |
|  * Can't index efficiently (need function on column)                |
|  * Distance calculation is expensive (trigonometry)                 |
|                                                                         |
|  S2/H3 BENEFITS                                                        |
|                                                                         |
|  1. INDEXABILITY                                                       |
|     * Convert 2D coordinates to 1D cell ID                          |
|     * Cell ID is an integer > standard B-tree index works          |
|     * Nearby points have similar cell IDs                           |
|                                                                         |
|  2. EFFICIENT RANGE QUERIES                                            |
|     * "Find all in 3km" = "Find all in cells [A, B, C, ...]"       |
|     * O(N) where N = results, not total drivers                     |
|                                                                         |
|  3. HIERARCHICAL                                                       |
|     * Zoom in/out by changing cell level                            |
|     * Good for different precision needs                             |
|                                                                         |
|  4. SHARDING                                                           |
|     * Shard data by cell ID                                          |
|     * Locality preserved (nearby data on same shard)                |
|                                                                         |
|  WHY H3 (HEXAGONS) FOR SURGE                                          |
|  * All neighbors equidistant                                         |
|  * Smoother surge transitions                                        |
|  * No corner artifacts                                               |
|                                                                         |
|  WHY S2 FOR LOCATION                                                   |
|  * Better for arbitrary shapes (covering)                            |
|  * More mature library                                               |
|  * Used by Google internally                                         |
|                                                                         |

|  SOLUTION: ATOMIC RESERVATION                                         |

|  Before sending offer, atomically reserve driver:                    |
|                                                                         |

|  4. Request B tries next best driver (D4)                           |
|                                                                         |

|  This is optimistic locking. We assume we'll get the driver,        |
|  but verify atomically before committing. Much faster than          |
|  pessimistic locking (SELECT FOR UPDATE).                            |
|                                                                         |

|  SIMPLE APPROACH: NEAREST DRIVER                                      |
|  -------------------------------                                        |
|  * Find drivers within radius                                        |
|  * Calculate ETA for each                                            |
|  * Pick lowest ETA                                                   |
|  * Pros: Fast, simple                                                |
|  * Cons: Not globally optimal, unfair to drivers                    |
|                                                                         |

|     eta_score: Lower ETA = higher score                              |
|     fairness: Driver waiting long = higher score                     |
|     acceptance: Reliable driver = higher score                       |

|  * High prices > more drivers come online                          |

## SECTION 6.6: QUICK-FIRE Q&A

Q: How do you ensure a driver doesn't receive multiple ride offers?
A: Reserve driver atomically with Redis SETNX before sending offer.

Q: How do you handle GPS inaccuracy?
A: Map matching - snap GPS coordinates to nearest road segment.

Q: How do drivers know about surge zones?
A: Push via WebSocket, show heat map in driver app.

Q: What happens if rider loses connectivity during trip?
A: Trip continues, driver marks arrival/completion, rider charged on reconnect.

Q: How do you prevent fare manipulation?
A: Route recorded on server, fare calculated from server-side data.

Q: How do you handle trips across city boundaries?
A: Use pickup location for surge, combine pricing from both cities.

Q: What's the latency target for ride matching?
A: <500ms from request to driver notification.

Q: How do you test surge pricing?
A: A/B testing, shadow mode (calculate but don't apply), simulation.

Q: How do you prevent drivers from gaming surge?
A: Monitor unusual patterns, detect coordinated offline behavior.

Q: What if ETA is way off from actual?
A: Log and analyze, retrain ML models, update traffic data.
